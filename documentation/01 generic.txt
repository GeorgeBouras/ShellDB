Access of ShellDB is though simple http REST calls

Info operations are available at path /db
The following methods are available

	localhost:7000/info/about
	localhost:7000/info/license	
	localhost:7000/info/enviroment

You have to open the tcp port 7000 at your firewall for remote access
Also you have to replace the localhost with your real server IP Address

Optional You can alter the received JSON anwser by using the switches

	... ?pretty=canonical=false       JSON keys are at random order (default)
	... ?pretty=canonical=true        JSON keys are sorted
	... ?pretty=true                  human readable (default)
	... ?pretty=false                 One line serialized
	... ?pretty=true&canonical=true   sorting and human readable

At the reply there are the keys

	"error_code"    : 0,
	"error_message" : "success"

If there is problem during the operation the error_code is not 0 and
the error_message contains the actuall error that you should correct.

So if we using the curl command line utility as client the
test urls can be written as

	curl -X GET http://localhost:7000/info/about?pretty=true
	curl -X GET http://localhost:7000/info/license?pretty=false
	curl -X GET http://localhost:7000/info/enviroment?canonical=true

These swithes can be used an all REST calls
