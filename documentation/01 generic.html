Accessing ShellDB features is done through a simple REST interface
For example to view is everything work you can use the routes

	localhost:7000/info/about
	localhost:7000/info/license	
	localhost:7000/info/enviroment

You have to open the tcp port 7000 at your firewall for remote access
Also you have to replace the localhost with your real server IP Address

Optional You can alter the received JSON anwser by using the switches

	... ?pretty=canonical=false			JSON keys are at random order (default)
	... ?pretty=canonical=true			JSON keys are sorted
	... ?pretty=true					human readable (default)
	... ?pretty=false					One line serialized
	... ?pretty=true&canonical=true 	sorting and human readable

So if we using the curl command line utility as client the
test urls can be written as

	curl -X GET http://localhost:7000/info/about?pretty=true
	curl -X GET http://localhost:7000/info/license?pretty=false
	curl -X GET http://localhost:7000/info/enviroment?canonical=true

These swithes can be used an all REST calls
