Query operations are available at path /query

POST db/query

Query the database at any level using filters
The filters are applied at search time so the I/O is reduced as much as possible
You can apply filters at keys, at values or both at keys/values

Filters are optional. Usually is better to hit a deep key directly than a shallow one using filters to narrow your search

As usuall the query is a json document posted at the server e.g.
curl -XPOST -H"Content-Type: application/json" -data @query.json 'localhost:7000/query?canonical=true'
